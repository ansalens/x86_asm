# Hardware architectures

- __Architecture defines what the hardware does.__
- People who design the architecture, define instructions, data types, formats, resources all in big specifications (manuals).
- Assembly language writers write an assembly language based on this architecture.
- Virtual machines implement their own architecture.
- Majority of PCs and servers run on x86 architecture.
- But the world is __dominated by ARM architecture__, because phones are built on ARM.

- From wikipedia:

> Hardware architecture is the representation of an engineered (or to be engineered) electronic or electromechanical hardware system, and the process and discipline for effectively implementing the design(s) for such a system.
